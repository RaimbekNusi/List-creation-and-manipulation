# List Creation and Manipulation (ENGLISH)

## Description

A list is a compound data type consisting of a set of data items arranged in a specific linear ordering.

In Python, lists have the following properties:
- lists are sequences, and therefore support indexing and slicing (like strings);
- lists may contain items of different data types;
- lists are mutable sequences, meaning they can be altered after they are created;
- lists are objects, and contain methods which you can call (just as strings do).

In Python lists are sequences, just like strings and ranges, which means we can use indexing and slicing on them. But lists are mutable, which means that you can modify the contents of the sequence. Strings and ranges are immutable sequences â€” once they are created, they cannot be changed.

## Problem description

The program needs to allow the user to add a new name to the list, remove the exsisting name from the roster, determine whether a name exists in the current version of the list, and print the entire roster to the console.

The program should look like this:
