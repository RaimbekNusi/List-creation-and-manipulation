# List Creation and Manipulation

## Description

A list is a compound data type consisting of a set of data items arranged in a specific linear ordering.
In Python, lists have the following properties:
- lists are sequences, and therefore support indexing and slicing (like strings);
- lists may contain items of different data types;
- lists are mutable sequences, meaning they can be altered after they are created;
- lists are objects, and contain methods which you can call (just as strings do).
